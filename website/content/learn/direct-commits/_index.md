Every time somebody pushes a commit that isn't properly formatted, Prettifier
adds a commit that fixes the formatting into the same branch.

{{% notice info %}} These commits are made to your remote branch on GitHub. You
have to run `git pull` to get them onto your developer machine. Use
[Git Town](http://www.git-town.com) to do this regularly during
